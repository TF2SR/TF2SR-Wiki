# TITANFALL 2 Speedrun glossary

## INTRODUCTION:

Welcome to the Titanfall 2 Speedrun glossary\! This is a list of every movement trick in the game, as well as a list of common level-specific terms you’ll hear runners use a lot. If you have a question about a trick you don’t see listed, let us know in #wiki in the Titanfall 2 Speedrunning Discord. Cheers\!

## MOVEMENT TRICKS:

### JUMP AND AERIAL MECHANICS

**Air strafe** \-
A technique used for aerial movement. By holding left or right in the air and moving your camera accordingly, you can turn corners, jump long distances, and increase your aerial velocity. If you’ve played/ran a Source game before, this is almost exactly the same. Titanfall 2 runs on a modified version of Source.

**Strafe lurch** \-
A sudden aerial movement that occurs on directional keyboard inputs that causes the player to “lurch” in the pressed direction if pressed within .5 seconds of jumping that generally results in a loss of velocity depending on the timing of the lurch.

**Tap strafe** \-
An extension of traditional air strafing. Refers to rapidy tapping W (or “forward”) shortly after jumping/double jumping while holding a strafe input to stack strafe lurches and make sharp turns. Only possible on PC.

**Fzzy strafe** \-
Similar to tap strafing, but relies on rapidly tapping left or right inputs rather than tapping forward during a strafe. Fzzy strafing essentially stacks strafe lurches over and over to allow for very sharp corners at the cost of significant speed. Only possible on PC.

**Spam strafe** \-
A sort of combination of fzzy/tap strafing; is performed by spamming directional inputs in rapid succession to achieve a similar, but usually sharper, movement to fzzy & tap strafing. Only possible on PC.

**Alternating tap strafing (alt-tapping):**
A kind of hybrid form of lurched strafing that alternates forward and lateral inputs while specifically allowing them to overlap to achieve lurch at a more rapid frequency than traditional tap strafing.

**No-lurch (prefix, NL)** \-
aka “**Lurchless.**” General term used to describe tech for keyboard players that removes incurring strafe lurch after a jump for a plethora of different purposes. Controller moves without lurch by default.

**Double jump (DJ)** \-
A second jump that can be used after any jump or contact with the wall/ground.

- **No-lurch double jump (NLDJ):** A double jump variation that removes suffering a strafe lurch, performed by strafing in a direction and pressing the opposite movement direction and double jumping at the same time, then releasing that direction to continue the strafe.

- **Side jump (SJ)**: A double jump used when holding left or right; provides heavy lateral momentum.

- **Spring jump**: Refers to a trick performed by doing two tick-perfect jump inputs in quick succession, resulting in a very large double jump.

**Moon Boots (MB)** \-
By disembarking from Brute/Northstar during their Flight ability, the player's gravity is reduced by \~15%. This makes Cooper very floaty and allows for extremely long jumps and tricks (see: "Super Fastball" in the Beacon ch. 3 tab).

### GROUND MECHANICS

**Slideboost (SB)** \-
After meeting a certain minimum velocity, holding crouch and sliding will give you a considerable speed boost.

**Slideboost timer** \-
After performing a slideboost, there is a brief delay (\~3 seconds) before you may achieve the boost again. Contact with a wall can usually reset the timer.

**Slidehop** \-
The most basic movement mechanic used throughout the run. Performed by jumping, holding crouch, and jumping again every time you land to negate ground friction slowdown.

**Extended slidehop** \-
Refers to extending a slide before the next jump in a slidehop sequence, which gives you increased height on that jump.

**Bunnyhop (bhop)** \-
Similar to slidehopping but performed from a standing position. Extremely similar to bhopping found in various other games. Has a tighter execution window than slidehopping.

**Half slide** \-
A niche tech performed by pressing crouch right before you hit the ground, essentially allowing slides from a “standing” position.

**Slant boost** \-
Performed by hitting a sharp downward slope at a specific point/angle (changes depending on the slope/hill) to achieve a significant boost.

**No-lurch jump start (NLJS)** \-
Refers to a jump, generally at the beginning of a slidehop string, without strafe lurch. Performed by holding forward, left, and right, then letting go of forward and a lateral direction and strafing.

**Circle jump** \-
Refers to starting a jump and strafe by running diagonal and holding forward and a strafe key, then immediately beginning the strafe after the jump and releasing the forward input. Not a true circle jump in comparison to other Source/Quake engine games.

**Superglide** \-
An instant slideboost achieved by pressing sprint, crouch, and jump while leaving a fixed animation such as a mantle or cutscene.

### WALL MECHANICS

**Wall jump** \-
A simple jump performed during a wallrun.

**No-lurch Wall Jump (NLWJ):** \-
A technique that allows you to jump from walls without suffering strafe lurch. Performed by holding a lateral direction as well as forward when you jump from a wall, then releasing forward and strafing in the held direction. Used for certain setups for long distance jumps like Kill Room or Heatsink skip.

**Wall bump** \-
Performed by holding crouch as you touch a wall. Gives you a small "bump" upward and refreshes your double jump.

**Wall kick (WK)** \-
An instant jump upon contact with a wall that can provide a massive speed boost. There are three different tick windows in which you can perform a wall kick:

- **1 tick**: Generally referred to as "firstie," this is a “frame-perfect” WK that gives the fastest and largest speed boost of them all.

- **2 to 3 ticks**: Provides a smaller speed boost than a firstie, but is still a significant boost. This is the window you'll want to get consistent with, as chaining multiple 3-framers together can lead to massive speeds.

- **4 to 5 ticks**: The latest window you can technically perform a WK. The speed boost from a 5 frame WK is marginal but you still aren't losing any speed due to contacting the wall.

- **No-lurch wall kick (NLWK/Strafe kick):** Allows for performing wall kicks without suffering strafe lurch. Performed by holding a lateral direction and forward before contacting a wall, and then performing the wall kick.

- **Neutral strafe kick (NSK):** Performed by holding all three primary directional inputs (left/right/forward) before doing a wall kick. Allows for more freedom in terms of strafe direction following a wall kick while still not incurring lurch.

- **Blind wall kick:** Refers to having to perform a wall kick without the camera tilt and “lean-in” animation that is normally present before a wall kick, usually due to the angle a wall is placed or sitting at.

- **Double wall kick:** In Titanfall 2, you can only regrab a wall once you're at a lower vertical position than when you originally grabbed it. “Double wall kick” refers to performing two wall kicks on the same wall by taking advantage of the aforementioned mechanic.

- **Crouch kick**: Effectively a wall kick-end boost. Performed by pressing crouch and jump at the same time immediately upon contact with a wall for a potent speed boost.

**Edge boost** \- Performed by jumping at the "edge" or corner of a wall during the last few ticks in which you have contact to achieve a boost.

- **Crouched edge boost (cEB):** Effectively an end boost-edge boost. Achieved by pressing crouch and jump at the same time when jumping at the “edge” of a corner or wall.

**End boost** \-
Performed by jumping at the very end of the wallrun animation. There is a set amount of time in which you can cling to the wall during a wallrun. If you jump at the very end of that animation, you receive the same speed boost as an edge boost.

- **Forced end boost (FEB):** Performed by holding away from the wall you are running on and jumping during the window in which you are leaving the wall. Allows for end boosts well before the standard time required to achieve one.

- **Lurchless/No-lurch forced end boost (FEBL):** A variation of a FEB that prevents you from suffering strafe lurch via a press inward toward the wall right before forcing yourself away.

- **Crouched forced end boost (cFEB)**: A forced end boost achieved by pressing crouch and jump at the same time while wallrunning. More powerful than a standard FEB. Can be performed lurchless by holding in toward the wall before the jump.

**Wall jump ladder** \-
Performed by jumping between two perpendicular or opposite-facing walls in quick succession to clear large vertical distances quickly.

**Bump launch** \-
Performed by placing yourself in a corner, holding crouch, and mashing jump. The rapid series of inputted wallbumps and jumps launches the player upward.

**Banana peel timer** \-
Refers to lack of wall-friction the player experiences after performing a damage boost. The length of the timer is dependent on the strength of the damage boost itself.

### TITAN MECHANICS

**Swap reloading** \-
Performed by bringing up the Titan loadout menu, and quickly swapping from one loadout and then back to the one you had previously selected. Allows for faster reload times than waiting out the reload animation on most Titans.

**Tacticancel** \-
Titans that have a shield or block tactical ability (Exhibition, Ronin, Scorch, etc) can quickly use that ability after a swap to their specific loadout to cancel the animation where BT brings up gun, allowing you to shoot earlier.

**Disembark jump (DEJ)** \-
Performed by pressing jump toward the end of the Titan disembark animation (around when Cooper's feet touch the floor of the cockpit). When done correctly, you'll launch into the air directly from BT's cockpit.

- **No-lurch disembark jump:** A disembark jump without incurring strafe lurch. Performed by holding forward, left, and right, then letting go of forward and a lateral direction and strafing.

**Disembark boost** \-
Performed by pressing crouch and holding forward as you disembark. When done correctly you'll receive a considerable horizontal speed boost that can be easily transitioned into a slidehop. You cannot disembark boost while using a Titan dash, you must be sprinting.

- **No-lurch disembark boost:** A disembark boost without incurring strafe lurch. Performed by holding forward and a strafe key, then immediately beginning the strafe and releasing the forward input after a boost.

**Disembark clip** \-
Performed by using Brute/Northstar's Flight ability to reach/stand on unintended locations, then disembarking. Arguably the most consistent out-of-bounds method.

**Crouch Dash** \-
Performed by immediately holding crouch following a dash. This causes BT to retract his legs, which allows you to travel further through the air following a dash without being affected by ground friction. Best used when dashing off of a raised surface like a ledge or bump.

**No-lurch Titan dash (NLTD)** \-
Refers to a Titan dash, usually off a ledge and into the air, that doesn’t suffer strafe lurch. Performed by holding forward, left, and right, then letting go of forward and a lateral direction and strafing.

**Core/Health Glitch** \-
Performed by connecting to multiplayer, starting a private match, and adjusting the game settings to 500% Core Meter Gain & 500% health. By quitting the lobby and then quitting straight to main menu, you can keep the 500% modifiers in the campaign mode.

**Hover strafing** \-
Performed by holding forward and either left/right during Northstar or Brute’s hover ability, giving a small speed increase.

**Flame trap duping (trap duping)** \-
Using scorch; Refers to a tech used to ignite flame traps multiple times over using very specific methods such as looking straight up in the air and activating flame wall while standing over a flame trap.

### DAMAGE AND EXPLOSION BOOSTS

**Damage boot** \-
Generally refer to any sort of speed boost as a result of taking damage from a variety of different sources.

- **\[pilot, melee\]**: Getting hit by a melee/other physical attack from a Prowler or any IMC unit (grunt, spectre, stalker, reaper), can result in a large speed boost in the direction in which the enemy is facing you.

- **\[pilot, projectile\]**: Getting hit by any projectile (NOT HITSCAN) will give you a small boost depending on the direction you're hit from. This includes, among other things: Kraber shots, LSTAR/Mastiff/Mozambique projectiles, Drone shots, etc.

- **\[Titan, melee\]**: If you are hit with a Titan melee attack while your shield is down, you'll receive a very large burst of speed in the direction the enemy was facing.

- **\[Titan, projectile\]**: This boost also requires your shield to be down, and functions the same as the pilot projectile boost, but with the following weapons, among others: Northstar shot, Ronin shot, Tone missiles/40mm, Ion splitter rifle shot, Legion power shot, etc.

**EPG boost** \- Refers to using the EPG to damage boost, usually performed by flicking it behind you.

**Softball boost** \- Refers to using the softball grenade to damage boost.

**Frag boost \[Gauntlet version\]** \- Performed by cooking a frag grenade and letting it explode in your hand, giving the player a massive speed boost depending on your jump/wall kick timing.

**Frag boost \[standard version\]** \- Performed by cooking a frag grenade, dropping it, and jumping just as it explodes outside of the kill-radius. The resulting explosion gives a large speed boost.

**Gravity star boost (gstar)** \- Refers to throwing a gravity star at a surface and jumping as close to the star as possible right as it explodes.

**Satchel boost** \- Refers to attaching a satchel charge to a surface and then triggering the explosion right as you jump outside of the kill radius.
