glossary<!-- -->!<!-- --> This is a list of every movement trick in the game, as well as a list of common level-specific terms you’ll hear runners use a lot. If you have a question about a trick you don’t see listed, let us know in #wiki in the Titanfall 2 Speedrunning Discord.

A technique used for aerial movement. By holding left or right in the air and moving your camera accordingly, you can turn corners, jump long distances, and increase your aerial velocity. If you’ve played/ran a Source game before, this is almost exactly the same. Titanfall 2 runs on a modified version of Source.</p><p><strong>Strafe lurch</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
A sudden aerial movement that occurs on directional keyboard inputs that causes the player to “lurch” in the pressed direction if pressed within .5 seconds of jumping that generally results in a loss of velocity depending on the timing of the lurch.</p><p><strong>Tap strafe</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
An extension of traditional air strafing. Refers to rapidy tapping W (or “forward”) shortly after jumping/double jumping while holding a strafe input to stack strafe lurches and make sharp turns. Only possible on PC.</p><p><strong>Fzzy strafe</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
Similar to tap strafing, but relies on rapidly tapping left or right inputs rather than tapping forward during a strafe. Fzzy strafing essentially stacks strafe lurches over and over to allow for very sharp corners at the cost of significant speed. Only possible on PC.</p><p><strong>Spam strafe</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
A sort of combination of fzzy/tap strafing; is performed by spamming directional inputs in rapid succession to achieve a similar, but usually sharper, movement to fzzy &amp; tap strafing. Only possible on PC.</p><p><strong>Alternating tap strafing (alt-tapping)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
A kind of hybrid form of lurched strafing that alternates forward and lateral inputs while specifically allowing them to overlap to achieve lurch at a more rapid frequency than traditional tap strafing.</p><p><strong>No-lurch (prefix, NL)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
aka “<strong>Lurchless.</strong>” General term used to describe tech for keyboard players that removes incurring strafe lurch after a jump for a plethora of different purposes. Controller moves without lurch by default.</p><p><strong>Double jump (DJ)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
A second jump that can be used after any jump or contact with the wall/ground.</p><ul><li><p><strong>No-lurch double jump (NLDJ):</strong> A double jump variation that removes suffering a strafe lurch, performed by strafing in a direction and pressing the opposite movement direction and double jumping at the same time, then releasing that direction to continue the strafe.</p></li><li><p><strong>Side jump (SJ)</strong>: A double jump used when holding left or right; provides heavy lateral momentum.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spring jump</strong>: Refers to a trick performed by doing two tick-perfect jump inputs in quick succession, resulting in a very large double jump.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Moon Boots (MB)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
By disembarking from Brute/Northstar during their Flight ability, the player&#x27;s gravity is reduced by <!-- -->~<!-- -->15%. This makes Cooper very floaty and allows for extremely long jumps and tricks (see: &quot;Super Fastball&quot; in the Beacon ch. 3 tab).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ground-mechanics">GROUND MECHANICS<a href="#ground-mechanics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to GROUND MECHANICS" title="Direct link to GROUND MECHANICS">​</a></h3><p><strong>Slideboost (SB)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
After meeting a certain minimum velocity, holding crouch and sliding will give you a considerable speed boost.</p><p><strong>Slideboost timer</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
After performing a slideboost, there is a brief delay (<!-- -->~<!-- -->3 seconds) before you may achieve the boost again. Contact with a wall can usually reset the timer.</p><p><strong>Slidehop</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
The most basic movement mechanic used throughout the run. Performed by jumping, holding crouch, and jumping again every time you land to negate ground friction slowdown.</p><p><strong>Extended slidehop</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
Refers to extending a slide before the next jump in a slidehop sequence, which gives you increased height on that jump.</p><p><strong>Bunnyhop (bhop)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
Similar to slidehopping but performed from a standing position. Extremely similar to bhopping found in various other games. Has a tighter execution window than slidehopping.</p><p><strong>Half slide</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
A niche tech performed by pressing crouch right before you hit the ground, essentially allowing slides from a “standing” position.</p><p><strong>Slant boost</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
Performed by hitting a sharp downward slope at a specific point/angle (changes depending on the slope/hill) to achieve a significant boost.</p><p><strong>No-lurch jump start (NLJS)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
Refers to a jump, generally at the beginning of a slidehop string, without strafe lurch. Performed by holding forward, left, and right, then letting go of forward and a lateral direction and strafing.</p><p><strong>Circle jump</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
Refers to starting a jump and strafe by running diagonal and holding forward and a strafe key, then immediately beginning the strafe after the jump and releasing the forward input. Not a true circle jump in comparison to other Source/Quake engine games.</p><p><strong>Superglide</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
An instant slideboost achieved by pressing sprint, crouch, and jump while leaving a fixed animation such as a mantle or cutscene.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wall-mechanics">WALL MECHANICS<a href="#wall-mechanics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to WALL MECHANICS" title="Direct link to WALL MECHANICS">​</a></h3><p><strong>Wall jump</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
A simple jump performed during a wallrun.</p><p><strong>No-lurch Wall Jump (NLWJ)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
A technique that allows you to jump from walls without suffering strafe lurch. Performed by holding a lateral direction as well as forward when you jump from a wall, then releasing forward and strafing in the held direction. Used for certain setups for long distance jumps like Kill Room or Heatsink skip.</p><p><strong>Wall bump</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
Performed by holding crouch as you touch a wall. Gives you a small &quot;bump&quot; upward and refreshes your double jump.</p><p><strong>Wall kick (WK)</strong> <!-- -->-<!-- -->
An instant jump upon contact with a wall that can provide a massive speed boost. There are three different tick windows in which you can perform a wall kick:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1 tick</strong>: Generally referred to as &quot;firstie,&quot; this is a “frame-perfect” WK that gives the fastest and largest speed boost of them all.</p></li><li><p><strong>2 to 3 ticks</strong>: Provides a smaller speed boost than a firstie, but is still a significant boost. This is the window you&#x27;ll want to get consistent with, as chaining multiple 3-framers together can lead to massive speeds.</p></li><li><p><strong>4 to 5 ticks</strong>: The latest window you can technically perform a WK. The speed boost from a 5 frame WK is marginal but you still aren&#x27;t losing any speed due to contacting the wall.</p></li><li><p><strong>No-lurch wall kick (NLWK/Strafe kick):</strong> Allows for performing wall kicks without suffering strafe lurch. Performed by holding a lateral direction and forward before contacting a wall, and then performing the wall kick.</p></li><li><p><strong>Neutral strafe kick (NSK):</strong> Performed by holding all three primary directional inputs (left/right/forward) before doing a wall kick.
