# Sub120 Guide [???]

If you don't know what to learn first, you can start with the strats on this page. They're geared towards beginners and break up some of the longest sequences in Titanfall 2.
You definitely don't need to learn all of them before starting to speedrun, but they make everything a lot easier.

Most enemies don't need to be killed. Ignoring them can save a lot of time.

## Beginner strats

I would recommend learning these strats in the order they're presented. However, if you struggle with a certain strat, you can always go to the next strat and come back later. 

### Into the Abyss 2

### Dome skip

This skip is highly recommended for runners at every level, as it is one of the major sequence breaks (~3.5 mins) that is very easy to perform once learned. It is performed at the end of Into the Abyss 2.

While it is extremely easy, this skip is still very important to make sure you fully understand as an incorrect lineup on the fade to black can softlock you.

With a time save of ~33 seconds and an easy execution this strat is great for beginners. It's one of the first strats every new runner should learn. -mats
