### Titanless

There are many variations to this strat. Some are based on *Decepcaverns* and some on *Slingshot*. So learn one of those first and then base you Titanless route on them. 

:::

## Ash



The Ash fight can be skipped. There are 2 main variations of Ash skip that are used in runs: Hover Ash skip and E-Smoke Ash skip.

:::caution

 Hover Ash skip can only be done if you have access to the brute titan loadout, so you can only do it if you don't do Abyss 1 out of bounds.

E-smoke Ash is actually slower than hover Ash by about 5 seconds, but it's the only way to do Ash skip if you do Abyss 1 out of bounds, so do keep in mind that if you're doing Abyss 1 oob, you have to save more time than e-smoke ash loses for it to be worth it.

If you don't do any shenanigans in Abyss 1, Hover Ash skip is the best option.

### Hover Ash Skip (Brute required)

This one is the better option if you have Brute available in Abyss 3. -mats

:::

### E-Smoke Ash Skip

E-Smoke Ash Skip is divided into 2 parts, the actual skip and the ending section of the level. 

First, you should learn the skip.

After you were successful with the skip, you can chose between different strats for the Ending Section.
