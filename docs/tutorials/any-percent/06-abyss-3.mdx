### Titanless

There are many variations to this strat. Some are based on *Decepcaverns* and some on *Slingshot*. So learn one of those first and then base you Titanless route on them. 

:::

## Ash



The Ash fight can be skipped. There are 2 main variations of Ash skip that are used in runs: Hover Ash skip and E-Smoke Ash skip.

:::caution

 Hover Ash skip can only be done if you have access to the brute titan loadout, so you can only do it if you don't do Abyss 1 out of bounds.

E-smoke Ash is actually slower than hover Ash by about 5 seconds, but it's the only way to do Ash skip if you do Abyss 1 out of bounds, so do keep in mind that if you're doing Abyss 1 oob, you have to save more time than e-smoke ash loses for it to be worth it.

If you don't do any shenanigans in Abyss 1, Hover Ash skip is the best option.

### Hover Ash Skip (Brute required)

This one is the better option if you have Brute available in Abyss 3. -mats

:::

### E-Smoke Ash Skip

E-Smoke Ash Skip is divided into 2 parts, the actual skip and the ending section of the level. 

First, you should learn the skip.
