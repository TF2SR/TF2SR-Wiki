# ðŸ”¥ Trial by Fire

## Intro Fight

In the Intro section of Trial by Fire you need to escort Sarah to an elevator. To do this you need to clear out a bunch of titans. 
There are several strats for the Intro Fight but Encore has proven to be the most consistent.

### Encore

Encore is a glitch that allows us to have infinite flight core rockets. In order to do it, we first have to do a setup called robcore that gives us a free 100% core.
