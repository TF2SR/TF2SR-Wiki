# ☁️ Beacon 1

Beacon 1 is a short level and is, for the most part, an **autoscroller**.

:::caution Note

If you performed the Titanless route for Abyss 1 (Sandwich) earlier, its important to quickly exit to menu here and reload back into the level (this can also be done at the start of Effect & Cause 1 instead)
This is necessary to get Scorch and Brute which were missed because of the previous route in Abyss 1.

## Start

### Into dialgue skip

<YouTube youTubeId="VuwvcAvSb0U"/>

This skip involves immediately leaving BT, going all the way to the beacon control room, killing the stalkers attacking it, and going back to BT before he finishes some dialogue. It saves 45 seconds if done well, but you can mess some things up and still get most of the timesave.

This was briefly touched on in the video, but make sure you're concious of what weapon you bring into this level when doing this fight. You may have the spitfire, you may have the r-201 or r-97, or you'll have hemlock and firestars if you quit out after enc 3 and load b1. Just make sure you practice the enemy clear with whatever weapon you normally have when you do this level in runs.

Watcher Note: my mic went a bit robot mode for the first 10 seconds of the video, but then it goes back to normal shortly after, and it's not a problem for the rest of the video.

## Avoiding a Crash

Pay attention to his dialogue here, because entering too early could cause a crash; It is safe to enter if by the time the embark animation is over, BT says "Caution" or what sounds like "Chu-Yi" in mandarin. You are safe to enter if you see "This victory has raised our combat efficiency rating" in the subtitles. Otherwise, wait a few seconds to allow his dialogue to advance before embarking.

Wait for the door to open and slidehop to the end of the level.

### Prespeed

To hit the end-level trigger as quickly as possible, line yourself up with the furthest end of the wall where the far pipe connects. Right when the mission objective notifcation appears, start wallrunning and cFEB, then slide hop over to the door; it should open right before you "hit" it.
