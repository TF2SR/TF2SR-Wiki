# 🏁 The Gauntlet

Every strat will be in one of these color coded boxes to give you a rough idea for the difficulty.

Sometimes there will also be a comment from one or more authors if there is anything worth knowing. Usually this'll be an estimate for when a particularly hard strat is worth going for.

**These are just gut feelings though!** Don't be discouraged from trying out a strat if the author says "it's only worth it for a 1:18 goal time" and you're aiming for a 1:19. In the same vein, don't be discouraged if a strat is marked as 'easy' or 'medium' and you end up having a lot of trouble with it. We're always happy to help you out in our help channel on our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/P3JKjfx4uZ)

## Intro

:::diffe
Looking at the blue lights is pretty straight forward. The only thing to note here is that there is a short grace period between when the game lets you look up/down far enough to look at the lights and when the lights become active.

In effect this means that you can chill for looking at the first light and quickly flick to the second light to save frames. Top or bottom first doesn't matter.

## Simulation spawn

// [maybe add a note about when you gain movement here? i couldnt really do that succinctly unfortunately]

With the exception of wallrun skip, this section can be thought of as an autoscroller. You should still pay some attention to your route and movement, however, as depending on the speed of your progression there are a number of "bad dialogues" you can get from Lastimosa that would otherwise be skipped.

The dialogue cues to pay attention to are:
- You should reach the first wallrun in time so that Lastimosa has **not** finished the line "...enhanced mobility becomes second nature". Any dialogue starting from the line "beautiful, isn't it?" will lose time.
- The first wallrun doesn't become grabbable until after Lastimosa has finished that line, however. In Mandarin, jump onto the wall as Lastimosa says "...ee-yon **su hai**". // [we should find out what the actual mandarin is]
- When sliding under the rocks, reach the next area quickly enough that Lastimosa does **not** say the bad dialogue "Under here, stay low".
- Reach from here all the way to the firing range quickly enough that Lastimosa does **not** say any dialogue past the line "...people like you".

*These are just the most ideal scenarios, though, and most bad dialogues will only lose a few seconds to the autoscroller's ceiling. If you're a new runner, don't worry about it too much!*

### Wallrun Skip 

To skip a bit more dialogue in this section, you can build enough speed through raw strafing in the first stretch to pass the first wallrun tutorial without actually grabbing it. This saves 2-3 seconds [?] if done optimally.

[video here should cover both wrs and the setup where you just get a good kick on the tutorial wall]



Due to its difficulty, this skip is thought of among most runners as more of a "bonus" than something to actually reset on, so don't get discouraged if you can't consistently get it. You also don't lose any time by attempting and failing it, so I'd say you can feel free to give it a shot at any level.    -next racer 1 (one)

## Gun range

You'll typically have a good amount of dialogue time remaining here to grab an EPG from the ceiling wall above you: [probably put like a gif of the EPG grab here]

:::diffe

### Reload Skip
As Lastimosa's dialogue starts to runs out, be prepared to look above you. As soon as you see the gun racks falling down, start holding down your reload key and pick up the R201 from the rack when it becomes available. 
If done with the right timing, you will skip the R201's reload animation and can start shooting all the targets right away.

For safety, you can wait for the P2016's reload animation to visually begin to garuntee that you're on the right timing. 

[again could do with a smol gif i think]

:::

The game requires you to take out all targets **while aiming down sights** to continue, so you can simply spray down all 5 from left to right with the R201. (A bit of kovaak's might help though)


## Transition

If you're opting out of the EPG, simply take a kick on the wall to your right out of the firing range and slidehop to the following room. Depending on speed you may also need to avoid the left side of the small connecting corridoor, as Lastimosa teleports there and will have collision even if he hasn't appeared yet.

If you are using an EPG, you can usually fit in around 3 boosts on your way to the gauntlet. Most optimally you should boost at the same time as each slidehop, either starting from a standstill or from a flick-boost off the kick on the right side wall. Pay attention to your boost trajectories here, as it is very easy to have your EPG run you into one of the obstacles.

## Gauntlet

### The actual honest to god frfr gauntlet

On entering the staging area, grab frags from the top right corner of the room. Note that if you pass any other ordanance on your way there, you won't auto-pickup the frags and will have to manually interact with them.

[the entire gauntlet itself should be a video imo rather than splitting gauntlet strats here]

## Post Gauntlet

:::diffe

## Scoreboard dialogue skip

After you finished your gauntlet run, quickly start another and then cancel it to skip Lastimosa's rambling.

<YouTube youTubeId="xorkzcq7zls" />

:::

Go to lastimosa and choose the upper dialogue to move on.

![](img/gauntlet_dialogue1.png)

A few seconds later, choose the lower dialogue for less rambling.

## Titan Intro

Here you just need to wait for lastimosa to say this line:

![](img/gauntlet_TitanIntro.png)

Use your Titanfall Button once.

:::caution

Spamming Titanfall in this section can cause BT to explode which is a huge timeloss. 

:::

## Ending Cutscene

What follows is a cutscene, so you dont need to do anything until you get to the difficulty options, where you select easy. Ideally you spam Space + Enter to select it the quickest. 

![](img/gauntlet_difficulty-options.png)

:::note

We choose easy because the HP bars on enemy titans and bosses are lower, therefore they die faster. There is also a lower chance of dying, making more risky strats possible.
