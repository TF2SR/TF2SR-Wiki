# 📡 Beacon 3

## Intro

After loading in, run up the stairs and into the main room. Some dialogue will pass, and the door to the reactor room will open. 
**Keep in mind that the door won't open quickly if you are too far from it or if you don't have your Ark tool equipped**.

### Reactor Room 

Simply run around the room and shoot the cells, and be careful not to let the arc tool overheat. This room is not very different from a casual playthrough except doing it fast. After returning from the Reactor room make sure to pick up the L-Star for the Dish Fight later in Beacon 3. 
If you do SFBD or HFB later in the level, you should also throw away your nades now.

## Fastball

:::info Watch out!

All Fastball strats require you to have **Moon Boots first**!

Moon Boots reduces your gravity by 15% which is needed for all Fastball strats. But even if you don't do any advanced Fastball strats yet, it's still very useful to learn and perform. -mats

:::

### Fastball 

Fastball is a difficult yet rewarding segment, often referred to as "the highlight of the run". It consists of using a combination of *Moon Boots* and other movement techniques to travel across the majority of Beacon 3's map very quickly. There are 3 different variations of it, all starting with climbing into BT's hand **without crouching or jumping** and holding jump as he throws you.

### Super Fastball (SFB)

The oldest and most basic route. 

[video]

I'd recommend Super Fastball to every runner independent of skill. Even if you're uncomfortable with SFB you will still benefit from it as a failed SFB is still faster than not doing SFB in most cases. Backups and alternatives are explained in the video.  -mats

:::

:::info Watch out!

SFBD and HFB require you to get rid of all grenades before getting picked up by BT.

### Super Fastball Deluxe (SFBD)

Super Fastball Deluxe is different from SFB because it allows you to get the grav stars during the route instead of taking a detour later to get them.

[zweek's video is a placeholer as it is geared towards runners who kind of have a basic idea of how sfbd works -mats]

### Hyper Fastball (HFB) 

#### Crane Kick

Hyper Fastball holds many similarities to SFBD except you land on top of the spiral room instead of the right, then jump through the control terminal of the next crane and wallkick off of the right side; then, travel to the left side of this large room and make sure to hit the trigger on the left side of the platform that is the intended entrance to the large room. Then, do a diagonal double jump (forward + right + jump) once you have cleared the wall on the right in order to avoid losing all your speed by hitting the forward wall. Then make your way to the far side of the area and jump off of the guardrail, and onto the dish platform or the small area below it if you don't have enough height.

#### Panel Hop

[ask chill for this one -mats]

## Return + Dish Fight

:::info Watch out!

Return and the Dish Fight afterwards are closely tied together. 
This means if you do one strat for the return this might force you to do another specific strat for the Dish Fight. 
Make sure to read all notes on the intricacies of this section. 

:::

### Return

:::diffe

### Basic route
The Standard route consists of slide hopping onto the antenna and jumping off onto the same white platform used for sfbd, then climbing to the top of the far right building and wallrunning on the stack of metal to get down onto the area with a series of arc-activated platforms. Then just travel along the platforms, using the arc tool when/if necessary, and return to BT using a zipline or wallkick off of the nearby wall if required.


:::

:::diffm

### Poverty Zipless (P-Zip)

The Grav Star Route uses a grav star to launch the player towards the white wall at 60-80 kph, allowing them to reach the arc platforms without climbing to the top of the building. This is the most used method among runners.

### Standard Method

In the standard method, it's important to keep track of the time at which you embarked BT. First, swap to expedition and use your primary weapon to fire at the grunts leaving the dropship on the right while they are still in it. Then melee the central reaper until it is dead (usually 3 times). Reload if necessary, and shoot the second wave of grunts coming from the dropship on the left. Melee or step on any stalkers or grunts on the floor, then use the Acolyte pod to fire missiles at the remaining stalkers and grunts on top of and to the right of the beacon room. Add 58 seconds to the embark time and this is when you will kill the final 2 stalkers that respawn until the 58 second mark (this whole thing with the time will likely have to be verified, the timing is probably based on the trigger, not embark)

### The Tesco Meal Deal

(somebody please explain the accurate origin of the name of this)
The Tesco Meal Deal uses reverse trigger order to skip the waiting in dish fight, allowing the player to complete it as quickly as possible without having to wait for the game itself to advance.

#### Poverty Tesco

[insert 100% consistent icecream_man strat here]

#### Standard Tesco



#### Cooperang
*Very Difficult Strat*: using a very good launch (sending you about 120 kph and left of the direction of the beacon), wallkick off of the left beacon support and return to the grunt room, continuing like normal.

:::

:::caution

Note for editors:
- Idk if we still want to include the non-consistent poverty tesco and non-tesco returns because we have strats that are just as easy and faster -mats
- also idk how to structure this exactly

## Richter

:::diffm

[h00man's setup is goated it should be featured here -mats]

:::

## Elmo Clip

:::diffe

- Elmo clip is performed right after killing Richter and saves about 2-3 seconds.

- This strat is pretty easy to learn at any skill level. But it's also okay to skip over it at first as doesn't save that much time. -mats

:::danger Watch out!

While waiting for the dialogue to finish, don't use any of the ziplines around the map. 

It will cause the game to crash.
