# ðŸ“¡ Beacon 3

:::caution

**Note to editors:**
- include normal zipless and hyperzipless + poverty tesco (+icecream man poverty tesco strat?)
- other structure?
- richter fight in one video or one for each segment?

:::

## Intro

After loading in, run up the stairs and into the main room. Some dialogue will pass, and the door to the reactor room will open. **Keep in mind that the door won't open quickly if you are too far from it**.

## Reactor Room 

Simply run around the room and shoot the cells, and be careful not to let the arc tool overheat. This room is not very different from a casual playthrough except doing it fast :)

## Moon Boots

After some dialogue, embark BT and switch to Ronin as the platform falls. As soon as the door opens, phase dash onto the large rock forward and slightly to the right of the door. Alternatively, you can phase dash off of the rock and onto the cables that lead to the beacon. Follow the cables up and swap to brute before reaching the door. This will allow you to perform moon boots (which reduces Cooper's gravity, allowing you to do Super Fastball (SFB)). Hold forward into the beacons door while your crosshair is lined up with the dots on the center of the door and use brute's hover ability. While hovering, hold the interact button to disembark and then quickly pull out the arc tool and activate the cell next to the door. You will have to wait until the hover effect ends before shooting, so dont be alarmed if it doesn't let you shoot.

## Fastball 

Fastball is a difficult yet rewarding segment, often referred to as "the highlight of the run". It consists of using a combination of moonboots and other movement techniques to travel across the majority of Beacon 3's map very quickly. There are 3 different variations of it, all starting with climbing into BT's hand **without crouching or jumping** and holding jump as he throws you:

### Super Fastball (SFB)
The oldest and most basic route,

:::diffh

### Super Fastball Deluxe (SFBD)

Super Fastball Deluxe is different from SFB because it allows you to get the grav stars during the route instead of taking a detour later to get them. The timing for the double jump is different and must be done earlier, allowing you to jump completely over the black (scaffolding?) and land on the corner of the building below. Quickly jump as soon as you land on the corner and slidehop onto the weapon crate, picking up the grav stars. Jump onto the pipe (add image) and then onto the crane's (elbow? idfk), then wall/crouchkick off of the side of the spiral room, then land on the side of the next crane's base. wall/crouchkick onto the wall on the right, making sure to hit the trigger (in (color), shown below (add image)) use one of your grav stars on the white platform and time your launch so that it sends you either on to the side of the module, or next to the antenna coming out of it. climb up the to the module and interact.

### Hyper Fastball (HFB) 

Hyper Fastball holds many similarities to SFBD except you land on top of the spiral room instead of the right, then jump through the control terminal of the next crane and wallkick off of the right side; then, travel to the left side of this large room and make sure to hit the trigger on the left side of the platform that is the intended entrance to the large room. Then, do a diagonal double jump (forward + right + jump) once you have cleared the wall on the right in order to avoid losing all your speed by hitting the forward wall. Then make your way to the far side of the area and jump off of the guardrail, and onto the dish platform or the small area below it if you don't have enough height.

## Return


:::diffe

### Standard route
The Standard route consists of slide hopping onto the antenna and jumping off onto the same white platform used for sfbd, then climbing to the top of the far right building and wallrunning on the stack of metal to get down onto the area with a series of arc-activated platforms. Then just travel along the platforms, using the arc tool when/if necessary, and return to BT using a zipline or wallkick off of the nearby wall if required.

:::diffm

### Grav Star Route

The Grav Star Route uses a grav star to launch the player towards the white wall at 60-80 kph, allowing them to reach the arc platforms without climbing to the top of the building. This is the most used method among runners.

:::


## Dish Fight

:::diffe

### Standard Method

In the standard method, it's important to keep track of the time at which you embarked BT. First, swap to expedition and use your primary weapon to fire at the grunts leaving the dropship on the right while they are still in it. Then melee the central reaper until it is dead (usually 3 times). Reload if necessary, and shoot the second wave of grunts coming from the dropship on the left. Melee or step on any stalkers or grunts on the floor, then use the Acolyte pod to fire missiles at the remaining stalkers and grunts on top of and to the right of the beacon room. Add 58 seconds to the embark time and this is when you will kill the final 2 stalkers that respawn until the 58 second mark (this whole thing with the time will likely have to be verified, the timing is probably based on the trigger, not embark)

### The Tesco Meal Deal

(somebody please explain the accurate origin of the name of this)
The Tesco Meal Deal uses reverse trigger order to skip the waiting in dish fight, allowing the player to complete it as quickly as possible without having to wait for the game itself to advance.

#### Platform Launch

Use the bottom platforms and precise timing of the arc tool activation to launch yourself upwards, either landing on the crane, the black scaffolding, or even the far pillar (have an image highlighting these 3), then jump onto the aforementioned far pillar, throw down a grav star (this can be done before you land), and use it to get back to the grunt room. *Keep in mind that for this grav boost to work you must get around 70 kph or a lot of height; this is worth a lot of practice.* When you get to the grunt room, instantly throw down a grav star and shoot at the enemies sucked into it with an eva or a l-star. use the grav star to return to BT. Alternatively, ride the zipline or wall/crouchkick to return to BT in a slower but easier manner.
*if you land on the scaffolding after the initial boost, its important to land far back and double jump early onto the crane to avoid hitting the trigger. Ideally, landing on the scaffolding should be avoided in preference for landing on the crane or the far platform.*

#### Cooperang
*Very Difficult Strat*: using a very good launch (sending you about 120 kph and left of the direction of the beacon), wallkick off of the left beacon support and return to the grunt room, continuing like normal.

## Richter Fight

### Reapers: 
Using Ronin, melee the first two reapers 3 times until dead. The speed at which you do this does not matter to an extent as the next wave of reapers spawn after a set amount of time anyway. When the next wave spawns, use arcwave to damage the 2 leftmost reapers, then melee and shoot each one until they are all dead.

### Titans:
Switch to Scorch. Put your crosshair in the following position on the rock [image]. When Richter starts talking, walk towards the Titan's spawnpoints. Place your gas traps beneath the shield and step back to this rock. [image]. Once the Titans move towards you, flame dupe to kill them. 

### Richter:
When Richter's cutscene is over, arcwave him, shoot him twice with your primary, then activate sword core, use all the swings until it is out, then shoot him another 2 times. If he nukes, continue, otherwise, swap reload to finish him off. 

## Elmo Clip 
Use brute's hover ability, while holding forward and crouch, to climb onto the part of the room shown below [image]. Then disembark, this should put you inside the room. Re-embark and move around with BT. Once the platform starts to rise, disembark and this should put you outside while keeping BT inside. this skips a few seconds of dialogue and is, for the most part, risk-free. 

The rest of the level is a cutscene.

:::caution

While waiting for the dialogue to finish, don't use any ziplines! This will cause the game to crash to menu.
