# ⛰️ The Fold Weapon

## Intro Cutscene

When watching the intro cutscene, selecting the top dialogue option will be fastest.

After the first cutscene, BT's dialogue can be triggered early by walking backwards.

### Turrets



## Titan hill

:::diffe 

### Snugglecore

Use a long-range powershot with the legion loadout to hit multiple titans at once and charge up the core quickly. Then swap to ronin and use the sword core to dash to the next area.

## Door Skip

:::info Watch out!

Make sure to select Northstar [or Brute? -mats] before disembarking from BT. Otherwise some abilities might be on cooldown at the start of *Slone Fight*.

[I'd prefer to split up grunt and mrvn hallways in the future -mats]

## Slone

There are **three important factors** to consider for Slone. Of course, killing Slone is important but you also need to set up *Andyshot* for the Blisk Cutscene after. Another important aspect is Precharge which will be explained shortly. 

### Slone Fight

:::diffm

### Fzzy Slone

<YouTube youTubeId="2uz8o5i1LOU"/>

Unfortunately there are no easier strats than Fzzy Slone here. But a poorly executed Fzzy Slone is still faster than having no strat at all -mats

[Insert Info about Precharge here. -mats]

### Blisk Cutscene

:::diffe

### Andyshot


<YouTube youTubeId="I3Nh7qv3eOI"/>

With a time save of ~33 seconds and an easy execution this strat is great for beginners. It's one of the first strats every new runner should learn. -mats

Make sure to select the bottom dialogue option when talking to BT for the last time.
