# 🏞️ BT-7274

:::caution keep in mind

At the start of BT, you only have **4** frags available. You *can* route more than 4 frag uses into your run per level, but this introduces RNG by relying on enemies to drop frags.

## 18-hour-cutscene

:::info Good to know!

The infamous 18-hour-cutscene can be skipped by enabling 'Auto Load 18 Hour Save' in the livesplit settings for our autosplitter. It's the only cutscene skip allowed in Any%.
