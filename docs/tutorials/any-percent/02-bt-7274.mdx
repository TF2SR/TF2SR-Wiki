# üèûÔ∏è BT-7274

:::caution keep in mind

At the start of BT, you only have **4** frags available. You *can* route more than 4 frag uses into your run per level, but this introduces RNG by relying on enemies to drop frags.

## 18-hour-cutscene

:::info Good to know!

The infamous 18-hour-cutscene can be bypassed by enabling 'Auto Load 18 Hour Save' in the LiveSplit settings for our autosplitter. It's the only cutscene bypass allowed in Any%.

## Ravine Setup + Encampment

:::info

To get a good Ravine + Encampment transition (the hard strat for *Ravine + Encampment*) you need to do Ravine Setup first, which consists of doing a frag boost. 

If you don't want to do a frag boost here and want do an easier variation just skip over *Ravine Setup* and continue with the easy or medium strat for *Ravine + Encampment*.
