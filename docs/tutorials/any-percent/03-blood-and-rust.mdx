### Instant Disembark
**AKA:** Vizembark, Decembark
<YouTube youTubeId="ycgXzdBuP1o" />

#### Note!

When doing Instant Disembark, you will have to fight Kane with Expedition due to skipping the Tone Loadout. Expedition is about 5 seconds slower than Tone, so you'll want to be at least that much faster to save time with this route.

## Kane fight

:::note

If you picked up Tone, it is optimal to use it in the fight. 

However, if you performed *Instant Disembark*, you need to fight Kane with Expedition because you didn't pick up Tone. Expedition is about five seconds slower than Tone.

### Tone

I briefly mention in the video that sometimes Kane stays on the stage at the back of the arena, and it stops him from moving around. At the end of the video, I included an example of it happening. You can see that Kane barely moves around or fights back at all when this happens, so if you can manipulate him to stay on top of the stage, that is ideal.
