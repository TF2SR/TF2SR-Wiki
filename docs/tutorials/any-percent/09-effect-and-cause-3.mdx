# ðŸ›‘ Effect & Cause 3

:::tip good to know

This level will begin on the **same timeline** that the previous level ended on - this is important as the button at the start is only interactable in the past. 

Ideally, you should do an extra timeswap at the very end of effect and cause 2 so you can reach the button at the start of this level with no issues.

### Basic Route

<YouTube youTubeId="SzeFK5G2l2k" />

Even though this route is not that complicated, I wouldn't really recommend doing it. It is only slightly faster than Timestop and dying to the titans is quite likely.
Learning *Fan Boost* for this section is the best option in the long run. -mats
