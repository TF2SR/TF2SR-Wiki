## Intro



## Killroom

### Killroom

<YouTube youTubeId="GopuESPcoZo"/>

### Note:

If you are doing a full-game run, in Beacon 1, the control room has a Mastiff in a box near the door that you enter to transition to Beacon 2. It is easier to grab this Mastiff before entering Beacon 2 rather than acquiring it at the bottom of the stairs as shown in the video.

:::tip

Even though Softball-less KRS is generally considered to be harder, many people prefer it over Softball KRS because of its simplicity.
Try out both and see what works best for you!
