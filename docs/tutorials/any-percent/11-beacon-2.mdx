# âš¡ Beacon 2

## Intro

### Stair slide

### Walls 1

### 180

### Walls 2

[is this too much splitting up??]

Hitting the trigger vs going for softball should be explained in the respective krs tutorials imo -mats 


## Killroom

### Killroom

### Note:

If you are doing a full-game run, in Beacon 1, the control room has a Mastiff in a box near the door that you enter to transition to Beacon 2. It is easier to grab this Mastiff before entering Beacon 2 rather than acquiring it at the bottom of the stairs as shown in the video.

### Killroom Skip (KRS)

#### Softball KRS

#### Softball-less KRS

[insert different setups (nex, blaidan, mine) -mats]

:::

:::tip

Even though Softball-less KRS is generally considered to be harder, many people prefer it over Softball KRS because of its simplicity.
Try out both and see what works best for you!
