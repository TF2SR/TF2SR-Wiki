## Intro

:::info Important

Sprint and slide as soon as you gain control to get to Anderson's device. Don't just sprint to the device, that is slow. - [icecreamman]

As far as frag boosts go, the turret hallways frag is a pretty generous one. The speed it gives you is very rewarding, but it's also very forgiving since you can timeswap if you think the frag is going to kill you. If you want to start incorporating fragboosts into your runs, I'd recommend starting with this one. - [icecreamman]

### Prespeed

Prespeed is always going to be worth it in dialogue sections like this. Even though this is a medium difficulty strat, I highly recommend going for it even at a beginner level - [icecreamman]

This is not the hardest thing in the universe, but it took me a lot of time to get consistent at. My gut feeling tells me it's probably worth it once your goal time is around a **1:19:XX**

### Snuggleslide
While being a medium difficulty strat, missing Snuggleslide doesn't lose any time and so it is recommended to try the strat at any skill level.
