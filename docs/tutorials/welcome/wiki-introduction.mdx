# ðŸ‘‹Welcome

Welcome to the Titanfall 2 Speedrunning Wiki!
This page will give a quick overview of the wiki and show you how to navigate it. 

## For new runners

- If you're entirely new to Titanfall 2 Speedrunning, [Basic Setup](https://tf2sr.github.io/TF2SR-Wiki/docs/tutorials/welcome/basic-setup) provides you with all tools you need to get your first run on the leaderboard.

- In [Additional tools](https://tf2sr.github.io/TF2SR-Wiki/docs/tutorials/welcome/additional-tools) you can learn about some more tools to make your speedrunning journey easier. However, these are not required for doing your first run.

- The [first run guide](https://tf2sr.github.io/TF2SR-Wiki/docs/tutorials/milestone-tutorials/first-run-guide) is geared towards new runners who immediately want to start running. The most important strats and techs for beginners are explained in a beginner friendly way. If you're overwhelmed by the Any% tutorials, you will want to start here!


## For experienced runners

- The [Any% tutorials](https://tf2sr.github.io/TF2SR-Wiki/docs/category/any) explain each strat level by level. This is very helpful if you want to improve a certain segment or level of the run. 

- For any additional information about the Titanfall 2 Speedrun, visit the [Knowledge Base](https://tf2sr.github.io/TF2SR-Wiki/docs/category/movement).













## Strats

Every strat will be in one of these color coded boxes to give you a rough idea for the difficulty.

Sometimes there will also be a comment from one or more authors if there is anything worth knowing. Usually this'll be an estimate for when a particularly hard strat is worth going for.

**These are just gut feelings though!** Don't be discouraged from trying out a strat if the author says "it's only worth it for a 1:18 goal time" and you're aiming for a 1:19. In the same vein, don't be discouraged if a strat is marked as 'easy' or 'medium' and you end up having a lot of trouble with it.
